However, existing evidence for their importance relies heavily upon reduced-form regressions that do not account for the simultaneous production of cognitive and noncognitive skills. Moreover, existing constructs of noncognitive skill are typically chosen for their convenience, or else for their explanatory power over psychological survey items. In response, we analyze a decision-theoretic model of educational development to derive five candidate noncognitive skills, and we test their importance by adapting an established longitudinal and structural econometric model of multidimensional skill formation. We find\u0026colon; first, that noncognitive skills matter for cognitive development; second, that different aspects of noncognitive skills matter to different degrees; and third, that once a child begins to take her own decisions, her propensity to think analytically becomes the most important noncognitive determinant of her ongoing cognitive development.","tags":["Human capital","Cognitive development","Noncognitive skills","Education","Dynamic factor model","CES function","Production function"],"title":"Noncognitive Skills: Theory and empirics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iain Embrey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557446400,"objectID":"f236f8bdc727ee2aadcc7358e3c68a6d","permalink":"https://iainembrey.github.io/publication/2019-states-of-nature_mind/","publishdate":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-states-of-nature_mind/","section":"publication","summary":"Canonical economic agents act so as to maximize a single, representative, utility function. However, there is accumulating evidence that heterogeneity in thought processes may be an important determinant of individual behavior. This paper investigates the implications of a vector-valued generalization of the Expected Utility paradigm, which permits agents either to deliberate as per Homo economics, or to act impulsively. This generalized decision theory is applied to explain the crowding-out effect, irrational educational investment decisions, persistent social inequalities, the pervasive influence of non-cognitive ability on socio-economic outcomes, and the dynamic relationships between non-cognitive ability, cognitive ability, and behavioral biases. These results suggest that the generalized decision theory warrants further investigation.","tags":["Decision theory","Dual-self","Behavioural anomalies","Human capital","Social Exclusion","Unemployment","Poverty"],"title":"States of Nature and States of Mind: A generalized theory of decision-making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iain Embrey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"74a82059476e6f2860b03c0ef81aea64","permalink":"https://iainembrey.github.io/publication/2019-re-est/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-re-est/","section":"publication","summary":"Cognitive and noncognitive skills determine many life outcomes, and so there has been significant research interest into the technology by which they are produced.

We propose a new model of educational investment that endogenously separates disadvantaged children into a divergent low-investment equilibrium, and we observe that this education trap could transmit poverty between generations.

A typical dual-self model will formalise psychological or neuroscientific descriptions of the human decision-making process into an economic model of that process, and apply that model to provide an unified explanation for several behavioural anomalies. In this paper, we compare the foundations of Neoclassical and dual-self decision theories, we develop a generalised decision framework that nests both decision theories, and we use that framework to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the economic dual-self literature.

Yet normalization has remained notably absent from the microeconomic literature. This paper introduces the concept of normalization within the microeconomic context, and establishes that it could provide substantial improvements in the interpretability, the tractability, and the applicability of a broad class of economic production functions. Since any production function is merely a specialized interpretation of some decision-maker’s utility function, our analyses also generalize to the wider context of utility functions. We therefore conclude that the benefits of normalization may be pervasive.","tags":["Normalisation","Production function","Utility function","CES function"],"title":"On the Benefits of Normalization in Production Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iain Embrey","[Kim Kaivanto](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/kim-kaivanto/)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"d28c474f020bd56d8569a32cd079e1da","permalink":"https://iainembrey.github.io/publication/2018-phish/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-phish/","section":"publication","summary":"Normative decision theory proves inadequate for modeling human responses to the socialengineering campaigns of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks. Behavioral decision theory fares better, but still falls short of capturing social-engineering attack vectors, which operate through emotions and peripheral-route persuasion. We introduce a generalized decision theory, under which any decision will be made according to one of multiple coexisting choice criteria. We denote the set of possible choice criteria by $\\mathcal{C}$. Thus the proposed model reduces to conventional Expected Utility theory when $|\\mathcal{C}\\_{EU}|=1$, whilst Dual-Process (thinking fast vs. thinking slow) decision making corresponds to a model with $|\\mathcal{C}\\_{DP}|=2$. We consider a more general case with $|\\mathcal{C}|\\geq 2$, which necessitates careful consideration of how, for a particular choice-task instance, one criterion comes to prevail over others. We operationalize this with a probability distribution that is conditional upon traits of the decision maker as well as upon the context and the framing of choice options. Whereas existing Signal Detection Theory (SDT) models of phishing detection commingle the different peripheral-route persuasion pathways, in the present descriptive generalization the different pathways are explicitly identified and represented. A number of implications follow immediately from this formulation, ranging from the conditional nature of security-breach risk to delineation of the prerequisites for valid tests of security training. Moreover, the model explains the ‘stepping-stone’ penetration pattern of APT attacks, which has confounded modeling approaches based on normative rationality.","tags":["Phishing","Social engineering","Peripheral-route persuasion","Advanced persistent threat","Choice criteria","Dual self","latent class model"],"title":"Many Phish in the C: A coexisting-choice-criteria model of security behavior","type":"publication"}]
